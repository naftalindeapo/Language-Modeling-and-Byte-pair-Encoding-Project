# Language Modeling and Byte-pair Encoding
Language identification, the task of automatically determining the language of a given text, plays a crucial role in various applications such as information retrieval, machine translation, and text classification. Accurate language identification is essential for processing multilingual data effectively and enabling language-specific analysis. In this assignment, we aim to develop a language identification system based on character-level trigram language models. We aim to accurately predict the language of a sentence by training language models on training data from five different languages: Afrikaans, Dutch, English, Xhosa, and Zulu.
