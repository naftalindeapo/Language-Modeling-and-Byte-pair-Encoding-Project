# Language-Modeling-and-Byte-pair-Encoding-Project
This repository contains a notebook for a  project that focuses on training language models on data from multiple languages and evaluating their performance in language identification tasks. Additionally, BPE is used to explore subword tokenization and measure language similarity based on overlapping subword types.
